    <h2>Places I have lived:</h2>
    <p>My father was in the military, so I was born in Hawaii and moved around every four years or so until we settled down in Nebraska. After finishing high school, I went to school at the Air Force Academy in the Springs. I now live in LA, since LA AFB was the first assignment I got after I graduated.</p>
